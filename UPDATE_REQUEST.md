# Update Request: Fix CORS issue for music file loading

## Requested Changes
React app can't load music files due to CORS policy blocking HTTP requests.

Need to add CORS middleware to server.js:

1. Add  to the imports
2. Add  after creating the express app

The cors package is already installed. This will fix the No music files found issue in the React app.

Files to update:
- server.js (add CORS middleware)

## Status
‚è≥ Ready for code update
